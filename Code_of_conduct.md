## AgentOS Code of Conduct

## Pledge

Welcome to the AgentOS community! We're dedicated to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment for all contributors working on our modular AI assistant platform. To ensure a positive experience for everyone involved in building the future of AI automation, we pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

### Project-Specific Guidelines

For AgentOS specifically:

- **Agent Development Ethics**: When creating agents, consider privacy implications and avoid building agents for harmful purposes
- **API Key Security**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or sensitive credentials to the repository
- **Voice Data Privacy**: Respect user privacy when working with voice processing features
- **Testing Responsibility**: Test your agents thoroughly and avoid agents that could cause system damage
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain clear documentation for agent capabilities and limitations
- **Integration Safety**: Ensure new agents don't interfere with existing system functionality

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Maintainer Guidelines

- **Fair Review Process**: All contributions will be reviewed based on technical merit and alignment with project goals
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide helpful guidance for improving contributions
- **Transparent Communication**: Clearly communicate project direction and decisions
- **Security Focus**: Prioritize security and privacy in all aspects of the platform
- **Educational Support**: Help new contributors understand the AgentOS architecture and development practices

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the AgentOS project or its community. Examples of representing the project include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via official social media accounts
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events
- Contributing code, documentation, or other materials to the project
- Participating in project discussions, issues, or pull requests
- Engaging in technical discussions about AgentOS in public forums

Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at the repository's issue tracker or by directly contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Enforcement Actions

Depending on the severity and nature of the violation, enforcement actions may include:

1. **Warning**: Private or public warning about inappropriate behavior
2. **Temporary Restriction**: Temporary limitation on participation in project discussions
3. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from the project community
4. **Legal Action**: In cases involving illegal activities or severe harassment

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Technical Disputes

For technical disagreements about:
- Agent architecture decisions
- Code implementation approaches
- Feature prioritization
- API design choices

We encourage:
- **Evidence-based discussions** with code examples and benchmarks
- **Collaborative problem-solving** rather than adversarial debates
- **Respect for maintainer decisions** while providing constructive feedback
- **Focus on project goals** and user benefits
